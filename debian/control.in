Description: Sugar Learning Platform - finance planning activity
 Sugar Learning Platform promotes collaborative learning through Sugar
 Activities that encourage critical thinking, the heart of a quality
 education.  Designed from the ground up especially for children, Sugar
 offers an alternative to traditional “office-desktop” software.
 .
 Learner applications in Sugar are called Activities.  They are software
 packages that automatically save your work - producing specific
 instances of the Activity that can be resumed at a later time.  Many
 Activities support learner collaboration, where multiple learners may
 be invited to join a collective Activity session.
 .
 This package contains the Finance activity. Finance is a simple financial
 planning activity, it can be integrated into classroom assignments, or
 else used to track finances for a school club and it might also be useful
 for students who wish to help their parents with home finances.
